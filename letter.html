            <p>My Love,</p>
            <p>
                Happy three months baby. It’s so crazy to think we’ve been together for 90 days now and that I’ve known you for 230. Time really flies when you’re with someone as amazing as you and each one of those days has been filled with moments that have made me fall deeper in love with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ll miss you like crazy when I’m gone but I know we’re strong enough to handle the distance. You mean the world to me and I’m so lucky to have you in my life. Here’s to many more months and years ahead no matter the miles between us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I cherish every memory we’ve made and look forward to creating new ones again. Until then know that you’re always in my heart and on my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Till the end baby ❤️
            </p>
